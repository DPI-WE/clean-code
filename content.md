# Crafting Clean Code ðŸ›€

## Introduction to Clean Code Practices
Clean code is the hallmark of a thoughtful developer. It not only demonstrates consideration for your future self but also for others who may work on your code. Drawing inspiration from Robert Martin's principles in "Clean Code," this lesson weaves these timeless guidelines into the fabric of development, ensuring your codebase remains robust, maintainable, and enjoyable to work with.

## The Essence of Clean Code
Clean code is easily understood by anyone on the team. It is characterized by readability, simplicity, and the ability to be enhanced by a developer other than its original author. These attributes are crucial for the sustainability and scalability.

## Core Principles

### Follow Standard Conventions
Embrace conventions for naming, structure, and coding practices. This not only makes your code cleaner but also ensures it aligns with the expectations of your team.

```ruby
# Bad: Non-standard naming and casing in Ruby
class Userinfo < ApplicationRecord
  def fullName
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end

# Good: Conventional naming and casing in Ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
```

### Keep It Simple
Simplicity is at the heart of clean code. This means choosing the most straightforward approach to solve problems, utilizing built-in methods, and avoiding over-engineering solutions.

```ruby
# Bad: Unnecessarily complex (unless a hard requirement)
def greet(name)
  time = Time.now
  hour = time.hour
  if hour < 12
    "Good morning, #{name}"
  elsif hour < 18
    "Good afternoon, #{name}"
  else
    "Good evening, #{name}"
  end
end

# Good: Simple and Direct
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}"
end
```

### The Boy Scout Rule
Leave your code better than you found it. When working on a project, always look for opportunities to refactor and improve the code you touch, even if it's outside the scope of your current task.

### Seek the Root Cause
When bugs arise, don't just patch symptoms. Investigate and address the underlying issues, ensuring your applications are robust and reliable.

```ruby
# Bad: Patching symptoms
def process_data(data)
  return unless data
  data.strip!
  data.capitalize!
end

# Good: Addressing the root cause
def process_data(data)
  raise ArgumentError, "Data can't be nil" if data.nil?
  data.strip.capitalize
end
```

## Design Guidelines

### Promote Polymorphism
Embrace polymorphism in relationships and routing, allowing for cleaner, more maintainable code. Use polymorphism over conditional logic to make your models and controllers more extensible.

```ruby
class Animal
  def speak
    raise NotImplementedError, "This method should be overridden by subclass"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    "Woof!"
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def speak
    "Meow!"
  end
end

# Good: Using polymorphism to call the appropriate method
[Dog.new, Cat.new].each { |animal| puts animal.speak }
```

### Dependency Injection
Use dependency injection, especially in testing, to decouple components and make your code more modular and testable.

```ruby
# Without Dependency Injection
class UserNotifier
  def notify(user)
    Mailer.send_email(user.email, 'Notification')
  end
end

# With Dependency Injection
class UserNotifier
  def initialize(mailer)
    @mailer = mailer
  end

  def notify(user)
    @mailer.send_email(user.email, 'Notification')
  end
end

notifier = UserNotifier.new(Mailer)
```

### Law of Demeter
Adhere to the Law of Demeter by ensuring that objects interact with their immediate associations, reducing coupling and increasing cohesion within your applications.

```ruby
# Bad: Violating Law of Demeter
def display_user_country(user)
  country = user.address.country
  puts country.name
end

# Good: Adhering to Law of Demeter
def display_user_country(user)
  country = user.country_name  # delegate method in User model
  puts country
end
```

## Understandability and Names

### Consistency and Clarity
Be consistent in how you structure and write your code. Use clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables. Avoid cryptic abbreviations and ensure names accurately reflect the entity's purpose or function.

```ruby
# Bad: Inconsistent and Unclear Naming
class OrderProc
  def prc_ord(ord)
    chk_ord(ord)
    chrg_pymt(ord)
    snd_conf(ord)
  end
end

# Good: Consistent and Clear Naming
class OrderProcessor
  def process_order(order)
    validate_order_details(order)
    charge_payment(order)
    send_order_confirmation(order)
  end
end
```

### Encapsulate Boundary Conditions
Applications often interact with external services and APIs. Encapsulate these interactions within dedicated objects or services to isolate complexity and enhance readability.

```ruby
# External API client class for weather data
# Encapsulates all the details of communicating with the weather API
class WeatherApiClient
  require 'net/http'
  require 'json'

  API_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
  API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

  # Fetches weather data for a specified city
  def self.get_weather_by_city(city_name)
    uri = URI("#{API_URL}?q=#{city_name}&appid=#{API_KEY}")
    response = Net::HTTP.get(uri)
    JSON.parse(response)
  end
end

# Weather service that uses the WeatherApiClient to fetch and process weather data
# Separate concerns between data fetching (ApiClient) and data processing (Service)
class WeatherService
  # Returns a simplified weather report for a given city
  def get_weather_report(city_name)
    raw_data = WeatherApiClient.get_weather_by_city(city_name)
    format_weather(raw_data)
  end

  private

  # Formats raw weather data into a user-friendly report
  def format_weather(data)
    temperature = data['main']['temp']
    description = data['weather'].first['description']

    "The current weather is #{temperature} degrees with #{description}."
  end
end

weather_service = WeatherService.new
puts weather_service.get_weather_report("Chicago")
```

### Descriptive Names Over Comments
Strive to make your code self-explanatory. Choose method and variable names that convey their purpose without needing additional comments. When comments are necessary, use them to explain the "why" behind a decision, not the "what" or "how."

```ruby
# Bad: Non-descriptive naming with unnecessary comments
def calc_sal(hr_rate, hrs_per_week) # Calculates annual salary
  hr_rate * hrs_per_week * 52
end

# Good: Descriptive naming
def calculate_annual_salary(hourly_rate, hours_per_week)
  hourly_rate * hours_per_week * 52
end
```

## Code Structure and Functions

### Small, Dedicated Methods
Follow the single responsibility principle for methods. Each method should do one thing and do it well. This practice leads to more reusable and easier-to-test code.

```ruby
# Bad: Multi-purpose method
def manage_contact(name, phone)
  raise "Invalid details" if name.empty? || phone.empty?
  contact_file = File.open("contacts.txt", "a")
  contact_file.puts("#{name}, #{phone}")
  contact_file.close
  puts "Contact #{name} added!"
end

# Good: Small, focused methods
def add_contact(name, phone)
  validate_contact(name, phone)
  save_contact(name, phone)
  notify_user(name)
end

def validate_contact(name, phone)
  raise "Invalid contact details" if name.empty? || phone.empty?
end
```

### Variables and Functions Proximity
Declare variables close to where they are used. Organize methods so related functionality is vertically close, enhancing the readability and navigability of your code.

```ruby
# Bad: Declaring all variables upfront
def apply_discount(price, discount_rate)
  final_price = nil
  calculated_discount = nil

  calculated_discount = price * discount_rate
  final_price = price - calculated_discount
  puts "Discounted price: #{final_price}"
end

# Good: Variables declared near usage
def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate)
  final_price = price - (price * discount_rate)
  puts "The final price is #{final_price}"
end
```

## Testing
Tests are the bedrock of maintainable code. Ensure your tests are fast, independent, and repeatable. Embrace the one assert per test rule for clarity and simplicity.

## Handling Code Smells
Rigidity, fragility, and immobility are symptoms of deeper problems within a codebase. Regularly refactor your applications to address these issues, focusing on simplifying complex areas, removing duplication, and improving readability.
